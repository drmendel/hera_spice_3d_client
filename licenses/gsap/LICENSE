FAQ

Is it acceptable for AI tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, Lovable, Webstudio, etc. to generate GSAP code?
Absolutely! AI-generated code is not a "Prohibited Use".

What if a WordPress plugin or theme or other niche tool allows users to create GSAP-driven effects through a visual interface? Is that prohibited?
We want to encourage developers to build on top of GSAP, including visual tools that don't directly compete with Webflow's rich animation-building capabilities.
If you are not sure if your product might be considered a "Prohibited Use", feel free to contact us so we can talk through it!

Can I really use GSAP in commercial projects without paying anything?
Yes, really! Commercial usage is covered under the standard license. All of GSAP including the plugins that were formerly "members-only" like SplitText and 

MorphSVG can be used in commercial projects at no charge. Enjoy! üíö
