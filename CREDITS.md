## üõ∞Ô∏è Spacecraft Models (public/models/)

### Hera, Milani, Juventas  
**Author:** Mendel Dobondi-Reisz  
**Source:** Custom-built based on [ESA Hera SPICE Cosmographia models](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/HERA/misc/cosmo/models/obj/)  
**Modifications:** The original Cosmographia models were too large (~250‚ÄØMB), so these were manually rebuilt from scratch and optimized (~10‚ÄØMB) for efficient web use.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Celestial Bodies (public/models/)

### Didymos, Dimorphos  
**Source:** Shape models derived from [ESA Hera SPICE DSK files](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/HERA/kernels/dsk/)  
**Modifications:** Added generic textures for visual clarity. These are artistic enhancements and **do not** accurately represent the surface features of the real bodies.
